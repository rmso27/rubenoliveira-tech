/**
 * Mocks a browser-like environment for processes in the main thread by:
 * - Injecting browser globals (window, document, ResizeObserver, etc.)
 * - Loading studio environment variables from the project's sanity installation into process.env
 *
 * This is useful for commands like `sanity exec` that have to run user scripts
 * in the main thread of the process (but in a child process).
 *
 * Be cautious when using this, since it will pollute the global namespace with browser globals.
 *
 * If your code can run in a worker thread, you should use the `studioWorkerTask` function instead.
 *
 * @param basePath - The root path of the Sanity Studio project
 * @returns A cleanup function that removes the injected globals and environment variables
 * @internal
